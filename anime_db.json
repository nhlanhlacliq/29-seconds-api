        "question": "Ichigo Kurosaki is a teenager from Karakura Town who can see ghosts a talent which lets him meet supernatural trespasser Rukia Kuchiki who enters Ichigo's room in search of a Hollow a kind of monstrous lost soul who can harm both ghosts and humans. Rukia is one of the Soul Reapers (死神 Shinigami literally 'Death Gods') soldiers trusted with ushering the souls of the dead from the World of the Living to the Soul Society (尸魂界 (ソウル・ソサエティ) lit. 'Dead Spirit World')—the afterlife realm from which she originates—and with fighting Hollows. When she is severely wounded defending Ichigo from a Hollow she is pursuing Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo so that he may fight in her stead while she recovers her strength. Rukia is thereby trapped in an ordinary human body and must advise Ichigo as he balances the demands of his substitute Soul Reaper duties and attending high school. For aid in hunting the Hollows the pair ally with a trio of other spiritually empowered teenagers: Ichigo's high school classmate Orihime Inoue best friend Yasutora 'Chad' Sado and the Quincy—humans who have the ability to control spirit particles—Uryū Ishida \n Eventually Rukia is arrested by her Soul Reaper superiors and sentenced to death for the illegal act of transferring her powers into a human. Ichigo and friends enlist the help of ex-Soul Reaper scientist Kisuke Urahara who also enables Ichigo to access his own Soul Reaper powers to enter Soul Society and rescue Rukia. Shortly after the party's arrival in the Soul Society conflict arises among the captains of the 13 Court Squads when the captain of the fifth company Sōsuke Aizen is apparently murdered which causes the Soul Reapers to begin fighting amongst themselves. There after the Captain Commander Genryusai Shigekuni Yamamoto issues a wide spread search for Ichigo and his friends as being responsible for the murder of Aizen. However as Ichigo is almost successful in rescuing Rukia and Soul Society is on the verge of civil war Aizen reappears and reveals his intention to obtain the Hōgyoku (崩玉 lit. 'Crumbling Orb')—an orb of immense power—that Kisuke planted in Rukia's human vessel by faking his death and arranging Rukia's execution. Aizen is accompanied by his fellow conspirators Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen who are the third and ninth company's captains as they use Hollows to cover their escape into the Hollows' realm Hueco Mundo ('Hollow World') Afterwards Ichigo and Rukia reconcile with the Soul Reapers who view the former as a powerful ally and designate him as an official substitute Soul Reaper.\n Ichigo soon finds himself and his friends in escalating skirmishes with Aizen's army of humanoid Hollows the Arrancar as they are joined by the Vizards—Soul Reapers who were victims of Aizen's experiments in creating Soul Reaper/Hollow hybrids. When Ulquiora one of the Espada—Aizen's 10 most powerful Arrancars—kidnaps Orihime Ichigo and his allies enter Hueco Mundo to invade Aizen's palace. However as Ichigo rescues Orihime Aizen reveals her abduction was a distraction as he launches an attack on Karakura Town in order to sacrifice the souls of the living and create a key to the Soul King's Palace so he can kill the Soul King who reigns over the Soul Society. Already anticipating Aizen's attack the 13 Court Squads had already been waiting for him by moving the entire Karakura Town to Soul Society prior to his attack. When the Vizards join the remaining Soul Reapers to face their mutual enemy Gin reveals his own agenda of assassinating Aizen. However the latter then uses the Hōgyoku to become a Hollow-like being and overpower everyone. Ichigo ultimately succeeds in subduing Aizen at the cost of his powers and reverts to a normal human.\n Months later preparing for life after high school Ichigo is called back into action when Xcution a gang of Fullbringers—supernaturally aware humans like Chad—manipulate him and his loved ones in a scheme to siphon his Fullbring abilities. After his Soul Society allies restore his Soul Reaper powers Ichigo learns that Xcution's leader Kugo Ginjo was his predecessor. It's revealed that Soul Society didn't fully trust the substitute Soul Reapers so they used the Substitute Soul Reaper Badge given to the Substitute Soul Reaper to monitor and restrict his power output. Ginjo felt betrayed and swore vengeance to all Soul Reapers. Despite knowing the truth Ichigo decides to continue to trust his Soul Reaper friends and kills Ginjo. With his power return Ichigo once again is reinstated as Substitute Soul Reaper.\n After Ichigo regained his powers an army of Quincies known as the Wandenreich (見えざる帝国 (ヴァンデンライヒ) lit. 'Invisible Empire') appear and declare their own war on the Soul Society having already enslaved many Arrancars in Hueco Mundo. The group is led by Yhwach the ancient progenitor of the Quincies who seeks to kill the Soul King and rid the world of the fear of death. In their first invasion the Wandenreich kill many Soul Reapers including the Captain Commander Uryū joins the Wandenreich as a means to get close to Yhwach who was responsible for the death of his mother among other Quincies. Later on Ichigo and his friends aid the Soul Society in fighting the Wandenreich's second invasion but Yhwach proceeds to slay the Soul King and fully absorb it. In the final battle Yhwach returns to the Soul Society to conquer it but with the help from Renji Aizen and Uryū Ichigo finally defeat the Quincy leader.\n 10 years later Rukia becomes the new captain of the thirteenth company and has a daughter an apprentice Soul Reaper named Ichika with her childhood friend Renji Abarai.

        "question":"On a supercontinent Earth, powerful monsters and villains have been wreaking havoc in the cities. In response, the millionaire Agoni creates the Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an unassociated hero, hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds for his own enjoyment. He has trained himself to the point of being able to defeat any enemy with a single punch, but his unmatched strength has left him with an overwhelming sense of boredom. Saitama eventually becomes a reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown. Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association, but due to scoring low on the written entry exam, Saitama is placed at a low-entry rank, and his feats remain unnoticed and unappreciated by the public. The Hero Association calls all the top heroes to a meeting, informing them that the seer Shibabawa had a vision that the world is in danger before dying. Immediately after the meeting, an alien named Boros invades the planet. The heroes fight the invaders outside Boros's ship, while Saitama boards the ship and fights Boros, who gives Saitama the exhilaration he has been craving. Doubt remains if Boros was what the seer had seen, or if there was an even greater threat looming. Saitama meets other heroes, such as the martial artist Bang, the esper Blizzard, and King, a hero considered the strongest man on Earth. Monsters also begin to appear at a rising rate. Another growing threat is the rogue martial artist Garo, Bang's former apprentice and self-dubbed 'Hero Hunter' Garo, who fights and defeats heroes to grow stronger and become a 'monster' The monster influx is revealed to be the doing of the Monster Association, an organization composed of monsters intent on destroying the Hero Association. They attack various cities, kidnap a Hero Association executive's child, and recruit fighters by offering them 'monster cells', which cause humans to mutate into monsters with extraordinary abilities. Throughout all this, Garo bonds with a child who idolizes heroes, seeks out heroes to battle, and greatly improves his fighting abilities. The Monster Association attempts to recruit him, and kidnaps the child when Garo refuses. Garo enters the Monster Association headquarters in City Z to rescue the child, but is captured. The Hero Association also breaches the headquarters to rescue the executives' child and a chaotic battle ensues, in which City Z is destroyed. The majority of the Monster Association's leaders are slain, but many of the heroes, having grown overconfident in their abilities, are defeated. Garo, having achieved tremendous power, defeats the remaining heroes, before Saitama in turn arrives and defeats him. Despite the objections of the other heroes, Saitama spares Garo's life and lets him flee for parts unknown. In the aftermath of the battle, the Hero Association's poor performance leads to public opinion of them plummeting. Several heroes and officials decide to retire or defect to the Neo Heroes, a burgeoning rival group that appears to be more effective in handling the growing monster threats with its larger membership and the leadership of the hero Blue, who claims to be the son of the long-missing Blast. Meanwhile Saitama, after being informed of the corruption inside the Hero Association, takes it upon himself to lead the 'Hero Name Victim's Association' and seek justice for himself and several other heroes who were wronged.",

        "question":"Six months after the defeat of Majin Buu, peace has returned to Earth. Goku has settled down and works as a farmer to support his family. His family and friends live peaceful lives. However, a new threat appears in the form of the God of Destruction named Beerus, who is considered to be the most terrifying and the second most powerful being in Universe Seven. After awakening from decades of slumber, Beerus tells his Angel assistant and teacher, Whis, that he is eager to fight the legendary warrior whom he had seen in a prophecy known as the Super Saiyan God (超スーパーサイヤ人ゴッド, Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo), while threatening to destroy the Earth if he loses to him.[4] To protect Earth, Goku transforms into the Super Saiyan God to fight Beerus by using the power of five Super Saiyans, which includes Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and the child named Pan in Videl's womb. Goku shows an immense amount of power that is enough to impress Beerus. Despite losing, Goku's efforts appease the God of Destruction enough that he decides to spare the planet.While Goku and Vegeta leave with Beerus and Whis to train for a year, the remaining remnants of Frieza's army arrive on Earth in search for the Dragon Balls to revive Frieza. A few months after coming back to life and training, Frieza gathers his forces and returns to enact his revenge on the Saiyans. Despite achieving a new transformation called Golden Frieza, he is defeated by Goku and Vegeta, who have both mastered the Super Saiyan Blue transformation. Refusing to accept defeat, Frieza blows up the Earth with a suicide attack. Fortunately, thanks to Whis's ability to reverse time, Goku is able to slay Frieza.Champa, Beerus' brother and the God of Destruction of Universe Six, convinces Beerus to hold a tournament between the best fighters from their universes. Whis reveals that there are twelve universes in existence. The universe that Goku and his friends are from is called Universe Seven. Champa also reveals the reward for their tournament will be the Super Dragon Balls, which are planet-sized Dragon Balls whose wish-granting abilities are practically limitless. Champa intends to swap Universe Six's Earth, which was previously left barren by a nuclear war, with Universe Seven's for their cuisine. Goku and his friends join the tournament. Each match in the tournament shows different surprises and abilities. The tournament reaches its climax in the second-to-last match between Goku and Hit. After a failed attempt to lift the rules to face Hit in his full power, Goku forfeits the match. However, Hit forfeits the final match since he was inspired by Goku to do the same thing. The tournament concludes with Universe Seven's victory. Beerus secretly wishes for the Super Dragon Balls to restore Universe Six's Earth.Goku later meets and befriends Lord Zenō, who is the Omni-King of all universes. Goku promises to bring him a friend to play with. Later, Future Trunks reappears and brings bad news of a new and powerful enemy who has stolen Goku's body, known as Goku Black. Goku and the others eventually discover that Goku Black is actually a Supreme Kai apprentice from Universe Ten named Zamasu, who used the Super Dragon Balls to steal Goku's body from a different timeline as part of his plan to obtain immortality and wipe out every being that isn't himself.[5] In the end, after a long bloody battle, Zamasu attempts to kill the heroes by merging with the very fabric of reality itself, but is erased from existence along with the entire future timeline by Future Lord Zenō, who accompanies Goku back to the present timeline. Goku fulfills his promise to Present Lord Zenō by introducing him to his future self. Whis travels to the future to prevent Zamasu's rise to power.Some time after Future Trunks leaves for an alternate timeline, Present Lord Zenō and Future Lord Zenō hold a new tournament called the Tournament of Power (力の大会, Chikara no Taikai). At Goku's suggestion, the multiverse tournament features a team of fighters from eight of the twelve universes. However, it becomes a battle for survival when both kings declare that the universes defeated at the tournament will be erased.[6] Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Krillin, Android 17, Android 18, Piccolo, Tien, Master Roshi, and a temporarily revived Frieza join the tournament as representatives for Universe Seven to protect it. The Universe Seven team must battle against many formidable warriors from the other universes, such as Universe Eleven's Pride Trooper named Jiren. During the fight, Goku briefly attains a new godly form known as Ultra Instinct (身勝手の極意, Migatte no Gokui), which increases his agility and power. Ultra Instinct allows Goku to simultaneously attack and dodge without having to think of the latter.[7] The tournament ends with Goku and Frieza taking Jiren down along with themselves, which leaves Android 17 as the last remaining fighter and the winner of the Tournament of Power. He is awarded one wish from the Super Dragon Balls, which he uses to restore all of the erased universes. It is revealed that Present Lord Zenō and Future Lord Zenō expected the universes to be restored. If the wish was used for selfish purposes, then both kings would have erased all of existence out of anger. For his efforts in the Tournament of Power, Frieza is permanently revived and rebuilds his army. Goku and his friends return to their daily lives on Earth. While sparring, Goku reveals to Vegeta that he is unable to activate Ultra Instinct at will. Goku and Vegeta pledge to become more powerful and surpass their limits.Following the Tournament of Power, a revived Frieza and his henchmen are in search of the Dragon Balls once again. During his search, Frieza comes across two exiled Saiyan survivors with incredible high power named Broly and his father Paragus, the latter of whom wants revenge on Vegeta for his father exiling Broly before the Saiyan homeworld's destruction. After Broly overpowers both Goku and Vegeta in their battles, Goku suggests to Vegeta they should fuse into 'Gogeta'. However, before Gogeta can kill Broly, he is wished back to the planet Frieza found him on by Frieza's henchmen Cheelai and Lemo. Frieza flees Earth, vowing that he will get his revenge.[a]Sometime later, Goku, Vegeta and Majin Buu are contacted by the Galactic Patrol, who enlist their help to recapture a dangerous fugitive called Moro (モロ), who had been held prisoner for 10 million years after using his powers to extract the life force of countless planets. Their search for Moro leads them to New Namek, but they fail to stop his plan to use the Namekians' Dragon Balls to restore his full magical abilities and release all of the criminals in the Galactic Patrol's custody. Moro and the escaped convicts proceed to go on a murderous rampage across the universe while Goku and Vegeta make preparations for their impending rematch against him. While Goku seeks for a way to master Ultra Instinct, Vegeta heads to Planet Yardrat, where Goku learned the skill of Instant Transmission. After two months, Moro leads his army of convicts to Earth as the Z-Fighters and the Galactic Patrol make a stand until Goku and Vegeta arrive. Despite Moro fusing with one of his own henchmen and almost killing the Z-Fighters, Goku and Vegeta eventually return and turn the tables on him, with Goku revealing that he can now access Ultra Instinct at will and promptly beating Moro to the brink of death. However, in a last-ditch attempt to prevent his impending demise, Moro fuses with the Earth itself, saying that he will self-destruct and take the entire Northern Galaxy with him if Goku tries to kill him. Eventually, after absorbing energy fused together by Vegeta's new powers, Goku finds Moro's weak spot and destroys it, slaying the evil wizard and sparing the Earth from destruction.After Moro's death, Goku and Vegeta return to Beerus' planet to further train and become stronger. As Whis trains Goku to master Ultra Instinct, Beerus decides to train Vegeta in the ways of Destruction. As this is happening, a Cerelian mercenary named Granolah retrieves the remains of OG-73i (one of Moro's henchmen) and delivers the android to his employers the Heeters. Granolah learns from the Heeters that Frieza is alive and has returned with his army. Granolah vows to become strong enough to destroy Frieza and avenge the destruction of his people and home planet of Cereal.",

Although she is initially easily defeated by Takaharu Fukuroda, she finds a sentient sailor uniform that she names Senketsu, a Kamui (神衣, lit. 'Godrobe') which is completely made of Life Fibers and transforms her so that she can face Kiryuin and her trials and obstacles. Ryuko is befriended by her hyperactive classmate Mako Mankanshoku, a no-star student, and moves in with her impoverished family.When Satsuki reorganizes the allocation of Goku Uniforms through a battle royal and king-of-the-hill event known as Naturals Election, Ryuko faces the members of Satsuki's Elite Four, who wear powerful Three-Star Goku Uniforms, in a series of duels. After defeating three of her opponents, Ryuko's final fight is interrupted by Nui Harime, the wielder of the other Scissor Blade, revealing herself to be the murderer of Ryuko's father. In the ensuing fight, Ryuko becomes enraged at Nui, transforming into an uncontrollable monster in the process. Mako calms Ryuko down, while Satsuki prohibits Nui from entering Honnouji Academy. Ryuko becomes reluctant to wear Senketsu after the fight, until a disguised Nui convinces her to put Senketsu on once more. Nui promptly defeats Ryuko, shredding Senketsu in the process, but is confronted by Satsuki before she can kill Ryuko, and flees.With the Tri-City Schools Raid, Satsuki annexes the major schools in Kansai and the other regions of Japan, and quashes Nudist Beach (ヌーディスト・ビーチ, Nūdisuto Bīchi), a paramilitary organization led by Ryuko's homeroom teacher Aikuro Mikisugi.

Mikisugi reveals that the Life Fibers, which have been woven into all REVOCS clothing, are actually alien parasites that consume their wearers. When they devour the festival audience, Satsuki turns on her mother, revealing her end goal to have always been destroying Ragyo, but the rebellion is short-lived as Ragyo has fused with the Life Fibers to attain tremendous power. Ragyo recognizes Ryuko as her own daughter and Satsuki's younger sister, who survived the termination of a Life Fiber experiment and was raised in secrecy by Ragyo's missing husband, Isshin Matoi, formerly known as Sōichirō Kiryūin.A month later, Ragyo and the Life Fibers have devastated Japan and have captured Satsuki, leaving the Elite Four without Goku Uniforms and forced to hide out with Ryuko and the others at Nudist Beach. When they rescue Satsuki, Ragyo captures and brainwashes Ryuko into fighting her. After Ryuko frees herself, she and Satsuki challenge Ragyo, who plans to use a space satellite to command all Life Fibers to consume their human hosts and detonate the Earth in order to propagate the Life Fibers throughout the universe.

        "question":"Tatsumi is a fighter who, accompanied by his two childhood friends, sets off to the Capital in search of a way to make money to assist his poverty-stricken village. After being separated from his friends in a bandit attack, Tatsumi unsuccessfully attempts to enlist in the army and is swindled out of his money in the Capital. He is taken in by a noble family, but when an assassin group called Night Raid attacks, he learns that his noble hosts actually intended to torture and kill him as they had done to his friends.As a result, he joins Night Raid, which consists of the swordswoman Akame, the beastly fighter Leone, the sniper girl Mine, the scissor-wielding Sheele, the string manipulator Lubbock, the armored warrior Bulat, and their leader Najenda, a former general of the imperial army. Night Raid is also part of the revolutionary forces assembled to overthrow the prime minister Honest who is manipulating the young emperor for his personal gain despite the rest of the nation falling to poverty and strife.The members of Night Raid carry Teigu (帝具, anime: Imperial Arms), unique weaponry created 900 years ago out of extremely rare materials as well as legendary animals called Danger Beasts (危険種, kikenshu). The power of the Teigu is so overwhelming that it is said that when two Teigu users fight each other, at least one of them is bound to die.Although Night Raid successfully assassinate some of Honest's cohorts, they lose Sheele during a fight against capital garrison member Seryu and then Bulat when Honest recruits the Empire's sadist general Esdeath and her Three Beasts. Tatsumi receives Bulat's Teigu, Incursio, as a result while Esdeath replaced her slain subordinates with a group of Teigu-using warriors called the Jaegers. Night Raid, along with new recruits Susanoo (a humanoid Teigu owned by Najenda) and Chelsea, fight the Jaegers with Seryu, Wave, and Akame's younger sister Kurome among its ranks. Over time, the two factions gradually lose some of their members.When the revolution gains momentum, Honest forms a new secret police force, the Wild Hunt, led by his own son, Syura. But Wild Hunt heavily abuses its authority by killing innocent civilians for their own plans, antagonizing both the Jaegers and Night Raid. Mine was almost killed by Seryu's suicide bomb attack, but she was saved by Tatsumi. After a battle between Wild Hunt and the Jaegers, with casualties from both sides, Esdeath blackmails Honest into dissolving the rest of Wild Hunt. Syura is killed by Lubbock after he captures both him and Tatsumi. Lubbock is killed while attempting to escape, and Tatsumi is sentenced to death despite Esdeath's attempts to save his life. The remaining Night Raid members attack the execution site to rescue Tatsumi while being pursued by the imperial general Budo, who Mine manages to kill at the cost of her Teigu while falling into a coma.Due to the stress he experienced while escaping the execution site, Tatsumi caused Incrusio to transform. It would be revealed that Tatsumi caused the Danger Beast which Incrusio was created from, Tyrant, to awaken with the doctor predicting that Tastumi can use his Teigu a few more times left before it fully fuses onto his body and consumes him. As this occurs, Night Raid confronts the last members of Wild Hunt and finish them off, with Akame taking out big generals on the Empire's side. Akame leaves a message to Wave that she and Kurome intend to settle things as they promised each other. After his attempt to convince Kurome not to get through with it, fighting his way through Tatsumi, Wave manages to stop the sisters' duel and destroys Kurome's Teigu. With this, Wave and Kurome fake their deaths as they run off to start a new life together.After hearing the news of the remaining Jaegers' deaths, Esdeath resumes her duties as general to hold off the Revolutionary Army when they begin a siege on the capital to remove Honest from power. As a last resort, Honest convinces the emperor himself to join the fight with his family's Teigu. After the remaining Night Raid members assassinated those in the government who have been pulling the strings behind the stage, only Honest and Esdeath are their remaining targets. However, Honest rigged the emperor's Teigu to go berserk.To confront the emperor's Teigu, Tatsumi uses his last transformation to defeat it with Wave's help while changing into Tyrant. Before being fully consumed, Tatsumi asks Akame to kill him before he loses control and kills everyone. She does so during her battle with Esdeath, later revealed to have only killed the Danger Beast's soul so Tatsumi can live, managing to defeat the general at the cost of her own sword. Esdeath acknowledges her loss and uses her power to commit suicide while regretting that she never got Tatsumi to return her feelings. As the final battle unfolded, Honest attempted to flee before being mortally wounded by Leone after he fatally wounded her and she fused with the remains of her Teigu to give her enough time to capture him so the Revolutionary War can fully end.As Honest is later brutally executed with slow dismemberment for his crimes against the people, the Emperor accepts his own public execution while taking responsibility for his inaction as Najenda begins to rebuild their nation into better place. Tatsumi, still trapped in his dragon form, returns to his village with Mine after she recovered and gave birth to their child, who was conceived prior to Mine's coma. Kurome and Wave end up together as well, with the former still scarred by her past while the latter lost one of his internal organs as a price for using two Teigu at once. As for Akame, still working as an assassin to defend the restoring nation from those who would exploit it, she heads eastward to protect her nation and find a means to restore Tatsumi's human form.",

        "question":"The main protagonist is Mori Jin, a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea.[5] At the beginning of the story, he is invited to join a Martial Arts tournament called 'The God of High School' (or GOH). The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked. This intrigues Mori, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using 'Borrowed Power', a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: Full-Contact Karate expert Daewi Han and epeeist master Mira Yoo. These two would befriend Mori after their fights with him, and will become teamed together as the Korean Team after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals.",
